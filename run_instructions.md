# 🏃‍♂️ Run Instructions for AI Stock Market Predictor

Follow these steps to set up and run the **AI Stock Market Predictor** on your local system.

---

## 🧩 Step 1: Install Requirements

Install all the necessary dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

---

## 📓 Step 2: Launch Jupyter Notebook

Start Jupyter Notebook from your terminal or Anaconda prompt.

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Then open the file:

```plaintext
stock_market_analysis_fixed_Version2_(1).ipynb
```

---

## 💼 Step 3: Configure Stock Ticker

Inside the notebook, modify the stock ticker variable to analyze your desired Indian stock.

```python
ticker = 'TCS.NS'  # Replace with your preferred Indian stock symbol
```

### Examples:

* `'INFY.NS'` → Infosys
* `'RELIANCE.NS'` → Reliance Industries
* `'HDFCBANK.NS'` → HDFC Bank

---

## ⚙️ Step 4: Run All Cells

Execute all notebook cells sequentially to:

* 📊 Preprocess and clean stock market data
* 🧮 Engineer features like RSI, MACD, and moving averages
* 🤖 Train deep learning (LSTM) and machine learning models
* 📈 Generate predictions and visualizations

Once done, you’ll see plots comparing **actual vs predicted** prices, model performance metrics, and trend visualizations.

---

## 💾 Step 5: (Optional) Export Results

You can save:

* **Plots** — as `.png` or `.jpg` files
* **Predicted outputs** — as `.csv` files for further analysis

Modify the final cells in the notebook to specify your custom save paths, for example:

```python
plt.savefig("results/predicted_prices.png")
predicted_df.to_csv("results/lstm_predictions.csv", index=False)
```

---

## 🧠 Optional: Streamlit Dashboard (Future Integration)

You can extend this notebook into a **Streamlit dashboard** for real-time visualization and interaction.

Run this (after creating an `app.py` file):

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The dashboard can:

* Display live stock price charts
* Accept custom ticker input
* Show model predictions interactively

---

✅ **You’re all set!**
Your **AI Stock Market Predictor** is ready to analyze and forecast Indian stock trends using LSTM and ML models.

---

```

---

Would you like me to now generate the **`app.py` (Streamlit dashboard)** file for this project —  
with input for stock symbol, live plots, and LSTM prediction display?
